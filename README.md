# Neural Network from Scratch

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook  which demonstrates the implementation of a simple artificial neural network using Python. The notebook is designed to serve as an educational tool for understanding the fundamentals of neural networks, including their architecture, activation functions, and the training process.

## Features

- **Custom Neural Network Class**: Defines an `ArtificialNeuralNetwork` class with methods for initialization, feedforward, and backpropagation.
- **Activation Function Visualization**: Includes a visualization of the sigmoid activation function to better understand its characteristics.
- **Derivative Functions**: Implements the derivative of the sigmoid function, essential for the backpropagation step.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you will need:
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
3. Run the notebook in a Jupyter environment to see the neural network in action.
